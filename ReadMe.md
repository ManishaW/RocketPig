__________________
We are two sisters using our skills and free time to create an entertaining game for everyone. I (Manisha W) am a software engineering student and this is my first time using Unity to make a mobile game. I am having a great time learning all the different things unity is capable of.  Nadisha is an achitecture student who enjoys art. She created all the characters, icons, logos and backgrounds. We really hope that people of all ages can enjoy this simple little game.
