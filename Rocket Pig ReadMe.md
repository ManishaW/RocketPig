a) Fueling up: 
The first part of the game involves fueling up the rocket. At the bottom of the screen, slide as many corn into the slot as possible within 5 seconds. After that, it's blast off! (maybe changed to two tap alternation fuel up)

b) Tilt to catch stars, power ups and avoid asteroid showers: 
Tilt your device to move the pig side to side. Catch stars to gain more points. Get power ups to use them right away. Power ups can include invinsibility, shrinking and Xtra Fuel(?). 

c) Swipe to move comets and satelites out of the way: 
Move comets and satelites out of the way or avoid them.

7) ABOUT THE CREATORS
__________________
We are two sisters using our skills and free time to create something fun to play. I (Manisha W) am a software engineering student and this is my first time using Unity to make a mobile game. I am having a great time learning all the different things unity is capable of.  My sister (Nadisha W) is an achitecture student who enjoys art. She digitally drew all the characters, icons, logos and backgrounds. We really hope that people of all ages can enjoy this simple little game. Our goal for this game is 100 downloads on the Play Store.
