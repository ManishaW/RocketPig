7) ABOUT THE CREATORS
__________________
We are two sisters using our skills and free time to create something fun to play. I (Manisha W) am a software engineering student and this is my first time using Unity to make a mobile game. I am having a great time learning all the different things unity is capable of.  My sister (Nadisha W) is an achitecture student who enjoys art. She digitally drew all the characters, icons, logos and backgrounds. We really hope that people of all ages can enjoy this simple little game. Our goal for this game is 100 downloads on the Play Store.
